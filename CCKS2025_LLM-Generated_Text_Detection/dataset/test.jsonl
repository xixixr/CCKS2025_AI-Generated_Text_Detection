{"text": "I don't believe animals have intrinsic value. Humans seem to be the only creatures capable of placing meaning on their own or others lives. Animals may matter a great deal to us, but I have yet to be faced with evidence that animals are capable of valuing their own lives to the extent we do."}
{"text": "Thanks to their ability to learn flexible datadriven losses, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an integral part of many semi and weaklysupervised methods for medical image segmentation.

His quick adaptability and tactical awareness on the field made him a dangerous forward and key contributor to the team."}
{"text": "Corporate credit rating reflects the level of corporate credit and plays a crucial role in modern financial risk control. But realworld credit rating data usually shows longtail distributions, which means heavy class imbalanced problem challenging the corporate credit rating system greatly. To tackle that, inspried by the recent advances of pretrain techniques in selfsupervised representation learning, we propose a novel framework named Contrastive Pretraining for Corporate Credit Rating (CP4CCR), which utilizes the selfsurpervision for getting over class imbalance."}

{"text": "This whole argument started with my best friend. She believes in a soul and she believes true love is when 2 souls are the perfect match for each other and those 2 souls, when they find each other, spend eternity together or whatever. Basically everyone has that one person in the world that they are perfect for and are best suited for."}

The new Hopper architecture is designed to accelerate the training of Transformer models on Nvidia's new H100 GPUs by six times compared to previousgeneration chips."}
{"text": "Conventional object detection methods often struggle with the computational challenges and resolution variability inherent in processing largescale visual data. Our approach tackles these issues by dynamically focusing computational resources on regions of interest at higher resolutions, while maintaining a coarse overview of the entire image."}
{"text": "The other reviews are pretty spot on. this place was downright baaaddd. A buddy and I went there for lunch and I was pretty stoked to eat some fish and chips. The menu was what I expected and there were a decent number of combinations and options."}

Fire crews then helped some people in the venue cross the flooded pavement. Thames Water said a large pipe burst damaging the road but no customers were without water on Sunday."}
{"text": "However, as stealth technology grows, so does antistealth technology. Multiple transmitter radars such as those from bistatic radars and lowfrequency radars are said to have the capabilities to detect stealth aircraft. Advanced forms of thermographic cameras such as those that incorporate QWIPs would be able to optically see a Stealth aircraft regardless of the aircraft's RCS."}
{"text": "The idea is to recruit graduates from universities and train them over a period in various technologyrelated fields. The ultimate goal is to equip them with both hard and soft skills necessary for the digital transformation of government services.

{"text": "Prior highlytuned image parsing models are usually studied in a certain domain with a specific set of semantic labels and can hardly be adapted into other scenarios (e. g. , sharing discrepant label granularity) without extensive retraining. Learning a single universal parsing model by unifying label annotations from different domains or at various levels of granularity is a crucial but rarely addressed topic."}

I sat at the table, running my fingers over the waxy crayon that stuck off the paper, scratching chunks of it away."}
{"text": "Robustness to certain forms of distribution shift is a key concern in many ML applications. Often, robustness can be formulated as enforcing invariances to particular interventions on the data generating process. Here, we study a flexible, causallymotivated approach to enforcing such invariances, paying special attention to shortcut learning, where a robust predictor can achieve optimal i."}
