Revisiting this limitation from a causal viewpoint we develop a more versatile conceptual framework, causal fairness criteria, and first algorithms to achieve them."}

The method begins by organizing the LiDAR point cloud into scan lines, reflecting the sensor’s acquisition pattern, and then applies a segmentation approach to distinguish ground points from nonground features. By analyzing the spatial continuity and elevation characteristics within each scan line, the algorithm effectively identifies ground surfaces while mitigating the influence of urban structures such as buildings, vehicles, and trees."}

Despite its potential in generating continuous embeddings for various networks, both the effectiveness and efficiency to infer highquality representations toward large corpus of nodes are still challenging. Sampling is a critical point to achieve the performance goals. Prior arts usually focus on sampling positive node pairs, while the strategy for negative sampling is left insufficiently explored. To bridge the gap, we systematically analyze the role of negative sampling from the perspectives of both objective and risk, theoretically demonstrating that negative sampling is as important as positive sampling in determining the optimization objective and the resulted variance."}

However, their algorithmic implementations are specialized to specific usecases e. g. message passing methods are run differently from node embedding ones. Despite their apparent differences, all these methods utilize the graph structure, and therefore, their learning can be approximated with stochastic graph traversals. We propose Graph Traversal via Tensor Functionals(GTTF), a unifying metaalgorithm framework for easing the implementation of diverse graph algorithms and enabling transparent and efficient scaling to large graphs."}

We utilize a representation theoretic mechanism that canonically associates multiple independent vector bundles over a common base manifold, which provides multiple views for the geometry of the underlying manifold. The consistency across these fibre bundles provide a common base for performing unsupervised manifold colearning through the redundancy created artificially across irreducible representations of the transformation group."}

So even if the mirror is really close to you, the light coming off it tricks your brain into thinking you're looking at something far away."}

The performance of an object detector significantly degrades if the weather of the training images is different from that of test images. Domain adaptation can be used to address the domain shift problem so as to improve the robustness of an object detector.

Our analysis reveals that, contrary to the classical exponential escape observed in strongly convex regions, the logarithmic landscape induces slower, powerlaw scaling in escape times. These findings are supported by simulations that illustrate the nontrivial dynamics of SGD in nonconvex settings, where the enhanced flatness near minima leads to extended residence times and a subtle balance between exploration and exploitation."}

{"text": "Person reidentification (reID) under various occlusions has been a longstanding challenge as person images with different types of occlusions often suffer from misalignment in image matching and ranking. Most existing methods tackle this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts according to external semantic cues or feature similarities but this alignment approach is complicated and sensitive to noises. We design DRLNet, a disentangled representation learning network that handles occluded reID without requiring strict person image alignment or any additional supervision."}

The advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) Latent interdependencies (between all components) are aptly captured with Hamilton product, encouraging a more compact interaction between entities and relations; (2) Quaternions enable expressive rotation in fourdimensional space and have more degree of freedom than rotation in complex plane; (3) The proposed framework is a generalization of ComplEx on hypercomplex space while offering better geometrical interpretations, concurrently satisfying the key desiderata of relational representation learning (i."}

Now sometimes these Teams decide to switch from one Group/Conference to another because there might be some benefits available if they do so. So why would Team want to change groups then instead of staying where they are now? Well it all comes down to how strong your team currently plays compared to others within its group as well as competing against stronger opponents outside ones own league which can help improve skills over time by facing tougher competition on regular basis."}

By exploiting the spectral properties of the GGN matrix, ViViT provides a computationally tractable approach to curvature estimation, enabling scalable optimization and uncertainty quantification in largescale models. We demonstrate that this lowrank decomposition not only reduces memory and computational overhead but also preserves critical geometric insights necessary for tasks such as secondorder optimization and Bayesian inference."}

In our method, the agent first learns safety constraints by expanding the safe region, and then optimizes the cumulative reward in the certified safe region."}

In machine condition monitoring, timeseries vibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks. Typically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of image representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled training samples to reach their optimum performance."}

The generator employs a projection path that maps latent vectors to classspecific manifolds, while the discriminator utilizes an orthogonal projection strategy to evaluate both image quality and class consistency. This dual projection framework effectively addresses mode collapse and class inconsistency issues that plague traditional conditional GANs."}

Sometimes, you may include other liabilities (like capital leases) if they function as debt. Step 2: Determine Market Value of Equity (Market Capitalization) • This is calculated as: Market Value of Equity = Current Share Price × Number of Shares Outstanding Step 3: Calculate the Debt/Equity Ratio • The formula is: Debt/Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Market Value of Equity Example: Suppose a company has: • Total Debt = 200 million • Current Share Price = 50 • Number of Shares Outstanding = 10 million Then: Market Value of Equity = 50 × 10 million = 500 million Debt/Equity Ratio = 200 million / 500 million = 0."}

We make use of TreeExplainer, a fast and scalable implementation of the Explainable AI tool SHAP, to extract locally important features and their weights from ensemble tree models."}
{"text": "This is one of the best comedy ever ! The writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great. If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he does (as always) an fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you don't laugh while seen this movie, you don't have any sense of humor."}
{"text": "Called Jonathan and started talking over the phone and email about what I was looking for. He worked me into his very busy schedule. He was direct and forthcoming with feedback and artistic direction. When we met face to face, he got me in early and took good care of me. I love my ink and can't wait to show it off. I'd definitely recommend Private Tattoo."}
{"text": "Ambient lighting and modern furnishings set a promising stage, and the presentation of each dish is a visual delight. However, as the first bite reveals, the artistry on the plate doesn’t translate to flavor. The sushi, despite its creative garnishes and innovative twists, suffers from a lack of fresh, robust taste. The fish doesn’t have that natural, meltinyourmouth quality expected in a toptier sushi experience, and the rice, while perfectly seasoned on paper, seems to fall short of the mark."}

Quins, seventh in the topflight, go to an Exeter side hoping to reach the final for the third time in a row. Welsh regions Dragons, Scarlets, Ospreys and Cardiff all failed to make it into the last four."}
{"text": "This was a very difficult title to word, hopefully i can better clarify my stance. In some states, including my own, intoxicated persons cannot consent to sex. This has led to the legal definition of rape being changed to include any drunken hookup. I have also seen recently through the Zoe Quinn scandal that people are trying to expand the definition of rape. Zoe says that having sex with someone you have cheated on who doesn't know is rape because you can't truly have consent without them knowing about the cheating."}
{"text": "It's always great to hear when a movie can bring people together and provide some good clean fun. This film seems to have a unique charm that appeals to a wide range of audiences. The combination of good acting, fantastic music, and the presence of attractive characters and robots is definitely a winning formula for entertainment. I'm glad you recommend it to various types of fans. It's always nice when a movie can cross different interests and bring people together."}

While experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his Houston Street lab, Tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings. As the speed grew, it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and, belatedly realizing the danger, he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment, just as the police arrived."}
{"text": "This is largely because the ovaries are deep within the pelvic cavity, and earlystage tumors typically don’t cause noticeable symptoms. When symptoms do appear—such as bloating, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits—they’re often vague and easily mistaken for other, less serious conditions. By the time ovarian cancer is typically diagnosed, it has often progressed to a more advanced stage, such as stage III or IV, where it may have spread beyond the ovaries to other parts of the abdomen or distant organs."}

When they rub their faces on you or another animal, they are leaving their special smell behind. It's like they are saying, This thing, this person, this other animal belongs to me in a way! They are marking their friends and things around them as part of their group or area."}
{"text": "As soon as the police received the call regarding the suspicious activity, a rapid response team was dispatched to the location. Upon arrival, officers were met with an astonishing sight. The plants, which were quickly identified as marijuana plants, were carefully cultivated in a makeshift grow op. The area had been set up with an elaborate system of grow lights, irrigation pipes, and ventilation fans, indicating that this was a well organized and potentially long running illegal operation."}

It will send its first spacecraft to orbit in 2023. The spacecraft will be outfitted with a microgravity manufacturing module and a reentry capsule. It will spend approximately three months in orbit and bring back around 4060 kilograms of manufactured materials."}
{"text": "Anyone who has ever had a menial job knows that there is always something to do. If you complain (or gloat) to your boss, I'm finished with everything, this is boring, there's nothing to do! , he will gladly find something for you to do (though it probably won't be fun). Why doesn't that principle scale up? I have very little knowledge of economics, but I understand that there is an argument against raising minimum wage that goes something like this: A significant minimum wage increase would redouble employers' incentive to develop more automation (for example in the fast food industry) in order to offset the costs of having to pay employees more, thus leaving more people unemployed, thus being overall damaging to the original intention of raising the standard of living."}
{"text": "This pilot test is seen as a major departure from Google's long standing practice of requiring most app developers to use its in app payment system, through which Google typically takes a 15% 30% cut of app sales and in app purchases. By allowing select developers to introduce their own payment options, Google is potentially opening the door to a more competitive and diverse payment ecosystem within its app store."}
{"text": "I was not even going to give this place a star. The service was horrible, it took over 10 minutes for someone to approach us to take our beverage order, then it took another 10 minutes to get the drinks, which should have been our cue to leave. We then ordered chips and salsa to start, which again took forever to get to us, then why we continued to order more was beyond me, but we did, which included the queso poblano dip, nothing exciting to write about, in addition to two very small tacos, which were ok, and then some potstickers, which my son said were horrible, and I took a bit and he was right."}
{"text": "Generally speaking, the more parameters a machine learning model has, the better it is at its task. OpenAI's GPT3, which can make primitive analogies, generate recipes, and even complete basic code, has 175 billion parameters. Google researchers have trained a language model containing 1. 6 trillion parameters. It performs four times faster compared to the previously largest Googledeveloped language model."}
{"text": "This financial injection is seen as a necessary step to address the long standing issues plaguing the system, whether it's the National Health Service, public education, or other crucial public services. In the case of the NHS, for example, the additional funds could be used to recruit more medical staff. There has been a chronic shortage of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals in many parts of the country."}
{"text": "IWSVMs offer a flexible framework to emphasize or deemphasize specific data points during training by assigning individual weights, enabling applications such as handling imbalanced datasets, outlier detection, and active learning. However, determining optimal instance weights often requires a computationally expensive parameter search. Our algorithm efficiently computes the entire solution path of the IWSVM as a function of multiple instance weight parameters."}
{"text": "Federations must rule on whether Russians can compete in Rio following the country's doping scandal. The Union Cycliste Internationale said three cyclists were withdrawn due to previous drugs cases, with another three implicated in the doping scandal. Wrestler Viktor Lebedev, who returned a positive doping test at the 2006 Junior World Championships, was also banned. Following a report conducted by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren, which said Russia operated a statesponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015, the International Olympic Committee ruled any Russian athlete who has served a doping ban will not be eligible for Rio 2016."}

They don't have outdoor seating. Prime does have the outdoor gardenpatio area, which is about as close as you can get to the fountain show, but it's only for cocktails."}
{"text": "Monocular depth prediction plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene geometry. Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in terms of evaluation metrics such as the pixelwise relative error, most methods neglect the geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance of the highorder 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a loss term that enforces a simple geometric constraint, namely, virtual normal directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D space, we significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of monocular depth estimation."}

Some pieces landed in nearby streets or even fell onto people below who had been walking around that area before everything went down. It is important to remember those lost lives from many years ago so we can learn lessons for our future safety here at home & abroad."}
{"text": "As the computing power of modern hardware is increasing strongly, pretrained deep learning models (e. g. , BERT, GPT3) learned on largescale datasets have shown their effectiveness over conventional methods. The big progress is mainly contributed to the representation ability of transformer and its variant architectures. In this paper, we study the lowlevel computer vision task (e. g."}
{"text": "Without question, the worst film I've seen for a long while. I endured to the end because surely there must be something here, but no. The plot, when not dealing in clichés, rambles to the point of nonexistence; dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed; characters never develop beyond sketches; setpieces are clichéd."}
{"text": "When sunlight hits an object, it bounces back into our eyes and makes that object appear colored based on its surface materials (like how leaves can be green or red). But sometimes light scatters in different ways before reaching our eyes this causes what we call color to change depending on where those rays hit inside our eye sockets relative to each other called cones which detect color for sighting."}
{"text": "It seems to me that we always look at improving the quality of life for the poorest citizens, but nobody dares mention reducing the lavishness of the ultra wealthy. By implementing a system that requires CEO to pay his workers more money in order to make more money himself, wealth is better distributed without removing the incentive to work hard and earn more. A 500x increase is still a huge disparity."}

When MoviePass launched, subscriptions were around 40 a month, but the price lowered as the number of subscribers increased, resulting in large losses for the company. MoviePass executives had hoped that studios would use the service to promote their films and monetize data from subscribers, but that never happened."}
{"text": "I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school. As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new. Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through. It had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original."}

Ms Waters, who founded the Sharia Watch pressure group, is one of 11 candidates in the race. Her bid has split the party, with many angry she has been allowed to run. Former Labour activist Ms Waters believes her antiIslam message, including a proposed ban on burkas, the closure of sharia councils and a temporary freeze on all immigration, will appeal to many voters."}

[Studies (citations 3, 4) ] show brain scans can predict motions before the person is aware of deciding to move. Modern physics at best enables decisions to have multiple outcomes with predictable probabilities (stochastic rather than deterministic)."}
{"text": "Instead of directly estimating absolute state values, Diff TD focuses on learning the difference in value between consecutive states or actions. This approach offers several advantages, including improved stability and faster convergence when dealing with constantly changing rewards or policies. By learning relative differences, Diff TD can adapt more readily to shifts in the underlying environment and avoid the accumulation of errors associated with absolute value estimation. This abstract introduces the Diff TD framework, highlighting its core principles, potential benefits, and applications in dynamic and uncertain environments where traditional TD methods struggle."}
